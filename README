My custom build of DWM from suckless. The changes include (but is not limited to):
	The vanity gaps patch
	The swallow patch	
	Adding a scratchpad
	Changing the border of the currently active window
	Adding function for switching between tags using page up/down and move windows between tags using shiftmasks
	Vagrant tags (hidding currently not active tags)
