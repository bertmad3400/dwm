	The swallow patch	
	Adding a scratchpad
	Changing the border of the currently active window
	Adding function for switching between tags using page up/down and move windows between tags using shiftmasks
	Vagrant tags (hidding currently not active tags)	
	Adding custom keybinds for launching different commands and applications
	Added quite a few new layouts including:
		Centered master (and floating centered)
		Gapless grids
		Double deck
